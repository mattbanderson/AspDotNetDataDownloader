#ASP.NET Data Downloader

Ever wanted to programmatically download data from an ASP.NET web site? 

Those controls with the convoluted names and postbacks can make things difficult.

I wrote this app to make it easier.


##Usage
    
The /release folder has an executable. Change the .config values to meet your needs and run.

If you are not comfortable running an .exe (fair enough!), run:

    git clone https://github.com/mattbanderson/AspDotNetDataDownloader.git
	
Set your configs and build/run it yourself.
